# Adding Images
To add an image into the page you need to use an "<img>" element.
- It must carry the following two attributes:
1. src
2. alt
3. title

## Height & Width of Images
height : This specifies the height of the image in pixels. 
width : This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

## Where to Place Images in Your Code
1. before a paragraph.
2. inside the start of a paragraph.
3. in the middle of a paragraph.

## Rules for Creating Images:
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution

- When having many different colors in a picture we should use a JPEG. 
- Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

## Image Resolution
- Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. 

## Vector Images
- Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

## Animated GIF
- It shows several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

## Examining Images on the Web
- This can be achieved by right-clicking on the image and making a selection from the pop-up menu that appears. 

## HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption
- "<figure>" element contains images and their caption so that the two are associated.
- "<figcaption>" element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

# Colors
We can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways: 
1. Rgb values
2. Hex codes
3. Color names

## CSS3: Opacity
- The CSS opacity  allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. 
- The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity

## CSS3: HSL
- SS3 allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# Typeface Terminology
1. Serif : with extra details 
2. Sans-Serif : a much clearer desgin
3. Monospace : every letter has the same width

## Techniques That Offer a Wider Choice of Typefaces
- font-family 
- font-face 
- Service-based (Font-Face)

## Specifying Typefaces
The font-family property mallows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

## SIZE OF TYPE
The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font.

## Units of Type Size
- Pixels
- Percentages
- Ems

## UpperCase & LowerCase
we can use these properties to choose a case: 
- uppercase
- lowercase
- capitalize

## Leading
The line-height property sets the height of an entire line of text, so the difference between the fontsize and the line-height is equivalent to the leading.

## Alignment
The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of
text. The property can take one of four values:
  1. left 
  2. right
  3. center
  4. justify



## Indenting Text
The text-indent property allows you to indent the first line of text within an element.

## CSS3: Drop Shadow
The text-shadow property has become commonly used despite lacking support in all browsers.

## First Letter or Line
We can specify different values for the first letter or first line of text inside an element using:
- first-letter 
- first-line

## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF
- _JPEG_ is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. JPEG images don’t support transparency and are hence not usable for such cases.
- _PNG_ is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. PNG images support transparency in two ways — inserting an alpha channel that allows partial transparency or by declaring a single colour as transparent (index transparency).
- _GIF_ It was favoured over PNG for simple graphics in websites in its early days because the support of PNG was still growing. GIF images support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette as transparent (index transparency).

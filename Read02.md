# What's HTML? _HyperText Markup Language_
_**HTML**_ is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. _**HTML**_ consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

# Wireframing
## What is _**Wireframing**_?


_Wireframing_ is a practice which allows designers to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the design team.

## Examples of _**Wireframes**_: 
* Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.


* With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.

-Below you can see some pictures of Wireframes:

## How to make your _**Wireframe**_?
1. Do your research.
2. Prepare your research for quick reference.
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.
5. Add some detail and get testing.
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.

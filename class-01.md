# INTRODUCTION

## The ways in which people access the web
1. Browsers
2. Web servers
3. Devices
4. Screen readers

## How Websites are created
 * What you see
 The web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code to create the page and sometimes it also send JavaScript.
 * How Is It created
 websites are often written using HTML and CSS.

# STRUCTURE
The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.

- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
- Attributes  tell us more about eLements.
- Body: Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
- Head: This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page).
- Title: the contents of the "<title>" element are either shown in the top of the browser, or on the browser tab. 

# FORMS
- To collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
<form> element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

# EXTRA MARKUP
## DOCTYPES
Each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. There must be nothing before it, not even a space.

## COMMENTS IN HTML
We can add a comment that isn't shown to the users of a website. " <!-- --> " 

## ID ATTRIBUTE
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

## ClASS ATTRIBUTE
a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. 

## BLOCK ELEMENTS
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.

## INLINE ELEMENTS
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.


## Grouping Text & Elements In a Block 
- div
- span

## IFRAMS
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

## Information About Your Pages
1. meta
The meta element lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page.

2. Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

## New Html5 Layout Elements
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The point of creating these
new elements is so that web page authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page. 

## Headers & Footers
The header and footer elements can be used for:
- The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
- A header or footer for an individual article or section within the page.

## NAVIGATION
The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

## ARTICLS 
The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

## SECTIONS
The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

## HEADING GROUPS
The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading. 

## Figures
It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). 

## Helping Older Browsers Understand 
to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.


## Process & Design
1. Who is the Site For?
Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. 

2. Why People Visit You Website?
you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

3. What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?

4. What Information Your Visitors Need?

5. you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

6. How Often People Will Visit Your Site?

7. Site Maps
organize the information into sections or pages.

8. WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. 

9. Visual hierarchy 
refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

10. Grouping and similarity
are used to help simplify the information you present.

# INTRODUCTION
## How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive?
1. ACCESS CONTENT      
2. MODIFY CONTENT 
3. PROGRAM RULES             
4. REACT TO EVENTS 

# The ABC of Programming
## HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE
1: RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE 

2: CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY

3: USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN

# Links
## Writing Links
Links are created using the "<a>" element. Users can click on anything between the opening "<a>" tag and the closing "</a>" tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Linking to Other Sites
Links are created using the "<a>" element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

## Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site
We can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

- When linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

- We create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

- We can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to

# LAYOUT
Controlling the Position of Elements can be done by:

1. Normal Flow
2. Relative Positioning
3. Absolute Positioning
4. Fixed Positioning
5. Overlapping Elements

# Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

# Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases
or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

# Liquid Layouts
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

# CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. 

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

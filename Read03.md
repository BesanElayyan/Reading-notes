# **What is CSS?**
## **(Cascading Style Sheets)**
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc. 

It can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

## **CSS syntax**
CSS is a rule-based language.

The following code shows a very simple CSS rules:

## **How To Add CSS?**
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:


* **External CSS:** 
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

* **Internal CSS:**
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

* **Inline CSS:** An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS 
property.
 

 ## **CSS color Property**
 The color property specifies the color of text.

 ### CSS Syntax
 color: color |initial| inherit;

 ** Property Values**

| Color                  |	Specifies the text color. Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.      |
| initial                | Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial                                              |



## CSS Tools: Reset CSS
The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.

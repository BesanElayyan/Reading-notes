# LISTS
## Ordered Lists
- The ordered list is created with the "<ol>" element.

- Each item in the list is placed between an opening "<li>" tag and a closing "</li>" tag.

## Unordered List
- The unordered list is created with the "<ul>" element.
- Each item in the list is placed between an opening "<li>" tag and a closing "</li>" tag.

## Definition Lists
- used to define terminology.

## Nested Lists
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

# BOXES
- We can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. It also can control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.

- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.

- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# Decisions and Loop
an if ... e1se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:

1. one set if the condition evaluates to true

2. another set if the condition is false

## SWITCH STATEMENTS
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
- Falsy values are treated as if they are fa 1 se. The table to the left shows a hi ghScore variable with a series of values, all of which are falsy. 
- Truthy values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can be treated as if it were true.

# LOOPS
There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.

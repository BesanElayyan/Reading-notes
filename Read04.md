## Expressions and operators
_JavaScript_ has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence:
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

1. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

For example, 3+4 or x*y.

2. A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:

For example, x++ or ++x.
### Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand for the operations listed below:

Assignment	x = y	x = y

Addition assignment	x += y	x = x + y

Subtraction assignment	x -= y	x = x - y

Multiplication assignment	x *= y	x = x * y

### Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

**operator**: Equal (==)	

** Description**: Returns true if the operands are equal.	

**Examples returning true**:       

                                 3 == var1

                               "3" == var1

                                  3 == '3'


                                  
# Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

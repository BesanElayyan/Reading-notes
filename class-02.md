# TEXT
## HEADINGS

HTML has six "levels" of headings:
"<h1>" is used for main headings.
"<h2>" is used for subheadings.
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the "<h3>" element is used, and so on...

## PARAGRAPHS 
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening "<p>" tag and closing "</p>" tag.

## BOLD & ITALIC
By enclosing words in the tags "<b>" and "</b>" we can make characters appear bold. By enclosing words in the tags
"<i>" and "</i>" we can make characters appear italic.

## Superscript & Subscrip
The "<sup>" element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or" mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.

The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

## White Space
In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.

## Visual Editors & Their Code views
- Visual editors often resemble word processors
- Code views show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself.

## Semantic Markup
Text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages.

# INTRODUCING CSS
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

# Decisions and Loops
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
